<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The main tools for filtering the study table’s results are the Pie charts and the filters on the left side of the dashboard. Each section of the Pie chart acts as a separate section of filters, and when a filter from the Pie chart is selected the results containing that factor will automatically populate in the studies table below. A user can make one selection on each Pi chart to narrow the results in the studies table. On the left side of the dashboard are a series of filtering options that can be used to identify similar studies. At the bottom of the page is a table summarizing the main metadata that describes how these studies were conducted.</p>

Below are detailed instructions on how to effectively navigate and utilize the Multi-Study Page.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For your initial test, let’s use rodent studies as an example.</p></li>
<li><p>Start by selecting “rodent” as the organism of interest. Since combining DNA microarray assays is not supported, ensure filtering by both “rodent” and “RNA sequencing” in the assay technology type.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose two different rodent studies that encompass various tissue types. For instance, select “OSD-49” and “OSD-100.”</p></li>
<li><p>Mark the checkboxes beside the selected studies in the studies table.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the “Visualize Study” button to proceed.</p></li>
<li><p>In this example OSD-49 &amp; OSD100 have been selected, normalized with DESeq2 and their first 2 principle components plotted in a 2D scatter plot.

<p>Pair plots are used for Exploratory Data Analysis, where the plot visualizes the data in order to find a relationship between variables that can be continuous or categorical.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A “Pair Plot” is used to understand the best set of features to explain a relationship between two variables. It also helps to form simple classification models by making linear separations in a dataset.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enhancing difference visualization:</strong> The default display for the pair plot will be the comparison between two sets of data with a % difference color threshold of 20%. Two plots will be displayed on the dashboard for the ability to compare multiple sets of data simultaneously. In this example on the right, we can see an increase in the threshold reduced the number loci annotated as red. Clicking each of the drop-down menus will allow a user to change which axis the sample data is displayed on.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide55.png" alt="2 scatter plots, the graph on the right has had the % difference color threshold increase to 37. The red dashed line highlights the change in coloring caused by updating the graph after the threshold has been adjusted."><figcaption><p><em>2 scatter plots, the graph on the right has had the % difference color threshold increase to 37. The red dashed line highlights the change in coloring caused by updating the graph after the threshold has been adjusted.</em></p></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Refining Pair plot correlation visualization</strong></p>
<p>Upon selecting the green “Samples” button located on the plot, one is presented with the opportunity to adjust several correlation coefficient values. These values serve to quantify both the strength and direction of the correlation that exists between data points.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Coefficients closer to +1 indicate a strong positive correlation, while those near -1 suggest a strong negative correlation. A coefficient near 0 signifies a weak or no correlation. Selecting a different coefficient dynamically alters the spread of the data, with higher coefficients leading to tighter clustering and lower ones resulting in broader scattering.</p></li>
<li><p>Users also can view different data correlations by clicking the green “Samples” button at the top of the plot and comparing it to other study providing a correlation coefficient summary. Clicking this button will change the dropdown to show multiple correlation coefficients for a pair of samples from the OSDR.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Heatmaps allow researchers to quickly and easily identify patterns of gene expression that are associated with specific conditions or treatments and use color coding to indicate the magnitude of values.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>By measuring the number of RNA molecules produced by genes in a particular sample, researchers can determine the level of gene expression.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The default settings for the heat map are shown in the image below. The heatmap links genes depending on how alike they are based on the conditions set in the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Log2 Transformation:</strong> The Log2 transformation is available to enhance the display of genes with more pronounced differences. Applying Log2 transformation can reveal subtler variations in gene expression between conditions.</p></li>

<p><strong>Filtering Heatmaps</strong></p>
<p>Users can filter the genes displayed on the heatmap based on their significance or fold change.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Filtering by Significance (Adjusted p values) and log2 foldchange thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This filtering helps highlight genes with statistically significant expression changes. Analyze the heatmap to identify gene expression patterns associated with specific conditions or treatments.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can switch off the clustering of rows or columns of genes causing the dendrograms to be removed. This also affects how the heatmap links genes based on similarity. In some cases, toggling off these types of clustering can help focus on specific groups of genes and their expression patterns. Pay attention to color intensity and clustering.</p></li>

<p><strong>Heat map clustering options</strong></p>
<p>Users can select a clustering method to display results.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Choosing Clustering Method: The default is often set to UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean). Clustering helps group genes with similar expression profiles, making patterns more apparent so it can be useful to compare multiple options.</p>

<p><strong>GSEA stands for gene set enrichment analysis, a method to identify gene groups that are overrepresented in a large gene set. It uses statistics to pinpoint significantly enriched or depleted gene classes.</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0506580102">Link to read about GSEA</a></p>
<p>On the Gene Lab Visualization Portal, you’ll find a dedicated GSEA section for each study. Within this GSEA section, there are various parameters you can customize:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Choose genesets:</strong> Select the database geneset enrichment analysis. The default is “KEGG 2019,” which is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Permutations:</strong> Decide the number of permutations you desire and whether they’re based on phenotypes or gene sets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gene Number Range:</strong> Adjust the minimum and maximum gene sizes. Increasing the minimum size omits genes with fewer than 15 data points, same for the maximum size.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weighted Score Type:</strong> Defaults to one, representing the t-test. Alternatively, choose signal-to-noise, fold change, or log2 fold change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical Method:</strong> Select your preferred statistical method. The default is the t-test.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To update the plot with your changes, simply click “Update.” A range of plot types is available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) Table:</strong> View different gene sets in a table format. Export this table using the options at the top.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NES Plot</strong>: The default plot displays normalized enrichment scores based on gene sets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dot Plot:</strong> Similar to NES Plot, it showcases the top six gene sets based on false discovery rate (FDR). FDR indicates the likelihood that a result is valid, e.g., FDR of 0.25 means a 25% chance of validity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enrichment Plot</strong>: This reveals the fold change distribution of the top three gene sets with an FDR of under 0.25.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Plot:</strong> Visualize relationships between gene sets using a network plot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GSEA Info:</strong> For in-depth details about GSEA creation, statistics, and plot documentation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With these steps, you can effectively navigate and utilize the GSEA section, gaining insights into gene set enrichment analysis for your study. A more detailed explanation can be found in the earlier section on the OSDR single study data visualization application.</p>
