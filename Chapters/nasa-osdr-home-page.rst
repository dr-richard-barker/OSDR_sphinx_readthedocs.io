`\ **AI4LS:** <https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/ai4ls.html>`_ The AI4LS working group focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods to analyze complex, heterogeneous, multi-modal biological datasets. ML approaches have shown promise for deriving meaningful patterns from these datasets and creating mathematical models to fit patterns and minimize errors. The group aims to build ML models to predict the physiological effects of spaceflight hazards using multi-modal biological and environmental data. Focus areas include causal inference, foundation models, and "self-driving" labs. Causal inference aims to elucidate causal relationships in complex biological data by combining invariance theory and ML methodology. Foundation models are trained on large, broad datasets and then refined on smaller datasets, which is relevant to space biology research due to limited sample size and restricted problem space. Self-driving labs are cutting-edge technology designed for space exploration. They employ automation and cloud-based systems to collect data points in a consistent and reproducible manner, leading to enhanced data acquisition and analysis.
