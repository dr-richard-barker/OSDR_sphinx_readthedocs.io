<h1>RadLab Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#radlab-overview" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p><strong>Please follow this link to access the</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://visualization.osdr.nasa.gov/radlab/gui/data-overview/"><strong>RadLab OSDR Visualization application</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>{% embed url=”https://visualization.osdr.nasa.gov/radlab/gui/data-overview/” %}</p>
<p>The application provides a central repository for radiation data from a wide variety of sensors that have flown on various spacecraft. This makes it easy for users to find and access the data they need, regardless of the specific sensor or spacecraft that collected it.</p>
<p>The OSDR RadLab application is also a powerful tool for data analysis. It provides a variety of features that allow users to visualize, analyze, and compare radiation data. This can be helpful for identifying trends and patterns in the data, as well as for understanding the effects of radiation on different materials and systems.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of the OSDR RadLab application is its ability to connect primary radiation data with metadata such as vehicle and time. This information is essential for understanding the context in which the radiation data was collected. It can also be used to filter and sort the data, making it easier to find the specific information that users are looking for.</p>
<p>The OSDR RadLab application is a valuable resource for researchers and scientists who need access to radiation measurements from space. It is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, and it can help users to understand the effects of radiation on different materials and systems.</p>

<h2><strong>Data overview page</strong> <a href="#txgh0vy0ejzk" id="txgh0vy0ejzk"></a><a class="headerlink" href="#data-overview-page" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><strong>When you first land on the RadLab you start in the “data overview” page.</strong></p>
<p>This page summarizes the different sensors, the time they were collecting data and the space vehical they were on. The graph is interactive so the users can select subsets within the data to drill down and the graph will rearrange to optimize the data visualization. On the bar on the left the user can then navigate down to a range of different visualization options.</p>

<p><strong>When you first land on the Time series plot page the graphs initially appear empty</strong></p>
<p>This page allows users to view the radiation data but requires users needs to define the periods and sensors of interest.</p>

<li><p>Select either “Total dose rate” or “Total flux” values.</p></li>

<p>In this example 4 sensors have been selected for a 2-day period, an orange box highlights how a user can click on the graph and make a selection lasso to define a smaller region such as a 5-hour period as highlighted by the red arrow. The user can then explore the graph using the mouse to reveal metadata about the spacecraft, instrument, data source, time stamp, and total dose rate.</p>

<p>In this example, the user has selected a specific point in time and have decided to use regression to compare the results from 2 different types of sensors. The images show the meta options that were used to compare the REM and Lidal sensors. The orange dashed lines show how the user has selected. Region of the graph, this then updates allowing the user to see the data at a high resolution. The 3rd inserts zoom in to show that these graphs are interactive allowing the user to highlight specific data points using their mouse to acquire further information as to how that data point was acquired.</p>
